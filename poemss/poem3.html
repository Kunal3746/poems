            Is this really what you yearned for?
            Is this really what you fought for?
            Why you always hated me?
            Is it so easy to replace me?

            Why did I even trusted you?
            When I knew that you would leave.
            Is it because you were so special,
            That it slowly became my need?

            But I always say, "Ït's fine."
            Because I know you wouldn't come back.
            And now each day when I wake up,
            I erase you from my life.
